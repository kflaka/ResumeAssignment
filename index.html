          <img src="images/annie-spratt-unsplash.jpg" alt="serenity">
          <p id="fss">Flaka's Safe Space is a community where everyone is welcome. A shelter from those in abusive households and relationships.
          A place for those that feel like they're misunderstood or have nowhere to go. We are mental health advocates and promote mental health awareness.
          There are various pages explaining what mental illness there are, information on them, and support others dealing with them. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/" target="_blank">Trevor Project</a>,
          our focus is creating a safe place for those in the LGBT community but we are an inclusive organization that cares for everyone.
          We are a shoulder to cry on, a hand to hold, and more.
